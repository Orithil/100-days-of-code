# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 1, 2019
##### First GitHub repository

**Today's Progress:** I'm working on Python script to migrate some of videos from our company's CDN provider to youtube. The part of the script that is currently written uses calls to API that CDN provider has, downloads each file and saves it's infornation (id, name and filepath) to JSON.

**Up next:**  
* Refactoring script to separate utility functions from main call.
* Modify script so it would take credential as commandline arguments.
              
**Thoughts:** This is my first serious project in Python and I think it will help me to grow professionaly towards geting a job in programming. I'm going to learn google's youtube API and MYSQLAlchemy and this should be superhelpful for backend development.
