# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 1, 2019
##### First GitHub repository

**Today's Progress:** I'm working on Python script to migrate some of videos from our company's CDN provider to youtube. The part of the script that is currently written uses calls to API that CDN provider has, downloads each file and saves it's infornation (id, name and filepath) to JSON.

**Up next:**  
* Refactoring script to separate utility functions from main call.
* Modify script so it would take credential as commandline arguments.
              
**Thoughts:** This is my first serious project in Python and I think it will help me to grow professionaly towards geting a job in programming. I'm going to learn google's youtube API and SQLAlchemy and this should be superhelpful for backend development.

### Day 2: March 2, 2019
##### Get comfortable with argparse

**Today's Progress:** Learned about argparse and separated server credential completely from code. Now it can be provided from separate JSON file. Also learned about sys.exit() function wich allows to exit script after catching exception or error. Also learning how to do atomic commits in git mixing this approuch with gitflow. 

**Up next:**  
* Refactoring script to separate utility functions from main call.
* Add google-api authentication

**Thoughts:** Maybe I'm running in front of the train as it seems pretty complex, but I know a little bit about [git flow approach](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) (not the git-flow wrapper itself) and it seems very convenient. But I've never used atomic commits and it seems reasonable to master. [This article](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/atomic_commits_with_git) from Spakbox explains topic in comprehensible manner.
